Everyone does say, “ooh, books can change your life….”. But I always ignored as I thought we are living the digital age we have podcast’s, YouTube Videos, films that could give the same values as the books can give us. I know I am an idiot to think like this, and I realised this only after reading books. They have a lot of value in them, compared to the YouTube videos that summarised it. If you are a teenager like me, and you did think about reading as I thought in the past, let’s change it by reading these 5 books.

### 1. The Psychology of Money

As the name says, this book deals with the psychological aspect of Money. I have always thought why some people spend money like this, or don’t spend money on other things. When we start to think about their situations more critically, there are a lot of things which we can improve. We also have an urge to advise them like “Hey, if you invest money …”, “Don’t use credit cards…”. Instead of advising them, we can learn their thought process behind their decisions.

As you grow in life, you will come across different people with different, money beliefs and practices. Now, instead of criticising them, we can understand how their brain works. 

### 2. Digital Minimalism

This is one of my favourite books by my favourite author Cal Newport, and his book Digital Minimalism. The Technology has grown exponentially in the past 20 years. Along with this, there are many companies which want to make money by stealing our time and other resources. These products & technologies are very addictive and kind of control us in a way. As these technologies are new to us, we are not adapted to it completely where we could use them mindfully. 

This can be compared to fire, where in the early days we don’t know that to do with it, by time we learned to control it. Hence, for us to start using technology mindfully we need to use the technology that works for us, for that you need to be a minimalist.

That’s what the book is about, exploring different ways and strategies that can help us to become a digital minimalist. Sometimes it means deleting your social media apps on your phone and only accessing them through a computer, Or using a dump phone instead of a smartphone. Everyone has different choices and circumstances, so your mileage may vary.

### 3. Make Time

The reason, why you don’t exercise, learn something new or do whatever you want to do. It's something along the words “I Have No Time”, “ I Am Very Busy”. The book Make Time is written by two engineers at Google who has helped in the creation of G-mail and other services of Google, for stealing the most amount of their time. In this book, they show you different ways of how companies hook you on their platform.

This book, as they describe, is a cook book rather than a book, which means you don’t have to follow what’s said on it. Instead, you can read the whole book, learn its strategies and techniques and design something that works for you.

### 4. Deep Work

If you have read the books above and have time to do the things you want, then this is next. Deep Works again by Cal Newport Where he emphasise on the importance of Deep Work. In short, there are two types of work, deep and shallow work. In the deep work you are in a flow state you are doing the important things, for you need to do the deep work you need uninterrupted chunk of time, when you do the work.

When you are doing the deep work, you will be able to get more things done or make more progress. For example writing this blog is a deep work where it requires, lot of my attention and energy. Now when I will be editing this blog it’s shallow work as it does not require lot of energy and attention.

### 5. Atomic Habits

Now after you have removed your distraction and done your deep work, then the next step is to make it a habit, so that it becomes a part of your daily life. Atomic Habits by James Clear is a book exploring the power of habits and what habits are capable of. The good habits make a great difference when compared to bad habit when you are looking through the span of years.

Simple habits, like eating something sweet after every lunch, can cause a lot of trouble. On the contrary, if you have the habit of doing deep work every day, you will be able to achieve more things and finish your goals faster.
