Shelter is a FOSS app that uses "Work Profile" feature of Android to provide an isolated space where you install or clone your apps.
This is very useful when you have multiple accounts in same profile and want to separate them, or used to compartmentalise apps that does not respect privacy and user data. When you isolate app it cannot access data outside the profile

## Newpipe 

 You can say Newpipe is a youtube client, but there's more to it. Newpipe doed not use any Google framework libraries, or the YouTube API. It only parses the website in order to gain the information it needs. Hence you can use it without Google Services installed. Also, you don't need a YouTube account to use NewPipe.

- In Newpipe there is  a subscriton page, which is similar to youtube's subscription page
- Trending page based on your location
- You can Download Videos
- You can also view your history and create playlists
There is no data collection form youtube and no algorithm base content which designed to take all your time, plus no youtube shorts the main reason why changed from youtube to newpipe. You can also view contents form Sound-Cloud and Peer-Tube.

## Feeder
Freeder is an Free and Open Source RSS Feed Reader. Nowadays we don't require a rss feed reader as compared to old days. But I personally find it very useful as don't like to disturbed by notifications or waste time on watching algorithmic curated content. With help of feeder you add youtube channels, podcasts, blogs to it and you can set it refresh whenever you want or you can set that to manual, where it will search for new content and show you.
