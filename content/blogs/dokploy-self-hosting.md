# Goodbye Vercel | Hello Dokploy

Like many React developers, I’ve always leaned toward **Next.js** as my go-to React-based framework. Thanks to its tight integration with **Vercel**, deploying a Next.js app was as simple as pushing to Git.

But lately, Vercel has introduced several **limitations** on their free tier:

- Private Git repositories now require a **paid plan**
- There’s a **time limit on serverless API routes**
- Additional restrictions that make the platform less appealing for indie devs and hobbyists

To be clear, I don’t blame Vercel — businesses need to make money. But it’s simply **not the path I want to follow**.

So I began exploring **open-source alternatives**, and that’s when I found **Dokploy** — a powerful, self-hosted platform that offers nearly all the features of Vercel, and in some cases, even more.

In this post, I’ll walk you through:

- How I use Dokploy to deploy my web apps
- How I host my databases (MongoDB, SQL, PostgreSQL)
- How I self-host services like search engines and RSS readers

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To get started with Dokploy, you’ll need access to a **Virtual Private Server (VPS)**. Here are a few providers to choose from:

- [Contabo](https://contabo.com) _(my personal pick — affordable and reliable)_
- [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com)
- [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com) _(I had issues creating an account, but it’s very cost-effective)_
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com)

**Minimum recommended VPS specs:**

- 2GB RAM
- 30GB disk space

## ⚙️ Installation

The installation process is surprisingly simple.

### ✅ Before you begin:

Ensure the following **ports are open** on your server:

- `80` – HTTP
- `443` – HTTPS
- `3000` – Dokploy Dashboard

Then, install Dokploy using the one-liner script:

```bash
curl -sSL https://dokploy.com/install.sh | sh
```

You’ll be prompted to **create an admin account**. Be sure to save your credentials securely — this will be your access to the Dokploy dashboard.

## 🚀 Why I Chose Dokploy

Dokploy offers a wide range of features, but I primarily use it for:

- **Deploying Next.js apps** easily with Docker containers
- **Hosting MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL** for personal projects
- Running **self-hosted services** like:
  - My own search engine
  - Custom RSS reader dashboard

There are tons of other features Dokploy provides — like integrated CI/CD, Git deployments, SSL by default — but honestly, I don’t even use all of them yet.
